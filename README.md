# Udacity FEND |Project 3| Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to develop a application that combines weather data from an external API and user input to be displayed on the page.

##Specifications
This project runs on Node.js and Express, Cors, and BodyParser dependencies in order to create a local web server for housing data endpoints as well as GET/POST routes. 

## What I learned
- I learned how to install and implement Node.js as well as required dependencies.
- I learned about the basics of comuputer networking.
- The difference between client side and server side code and how they work together.

## Extras
As a bonus, I made adjustments to the default styling provided in the starter code. I created a function in app.js called changeBg() which pulls the current time from the browser and then changes the background color gradient to match the sky for the current time of day. 

I also added very basic error validation logic to the fuction called on form submission.
